    <h3>Pattonville Highschool</h3>
      <p>In Pattonville Highschool I spend most of my time either playing Volleyball or participating 
      in speech and debate. I completed in many tournament, having success at the national level and 
      performing well at many tournaments.</p>
      <p>I was a good student, but I would not consider myself one of the top students in the school
        by any means.</p>
      <p>Pattonville Highschool was very diverse and included students from diverse cultural and 
        socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>

      <h3>Southwest Baptist University</h3>
      <p>Because of my success at Speech an Debate in highschool, I was offered a large scholarship to
        compete at Southwest Baptist University. I did that for four years while pursuing a double major 
        of philosophy and biblical studies with a minor in ancient semitic languages. At this point, all 
        I knew about my future was that I wanted to pursue more education.
      </p>
      <p>So I began researching and applying to numerous universities. Many made my list, but I only completed
        applications for a few. 
      </p>
      <p>Ultimately, I settled on getting a master degree in communication from St. Louis University.

    <h3>St. Louis University</h3>
      <p>I accepted a graduate assistantship at Saint Louis University for their master program in 
        communication. While there I specialized in ethnography and worked closely with several professors 
        to help them with the project.
      </p>
      <p>Saint Louis University traces its origins to the Saint Louis Academy, founded on November 16, 1818 
        by the Most Reverend Louis Guillaume Valentin Dubourg, Bishop of Louisiana and the Floridas, and placed 
        under the charge of the Reverend Fran√ßois Niel and others of the secular clergy attached to the Saint 
        Louis Cathedral. Its first location was in a private residence near the Mississippi River in an area 
        now occupied by the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial within the Archdiocese of St. Louis.

			<h3>LaunchCode</h3>
			<p>LaunchCode has a track record of placing people in good coding jobs. That is something that I would like to take advantage of.</p>
			<p>As I conutinue doing work on the side to earn money, I have been focusing more and more on coding and programming.</p>
			<p>Because of my background in predicate and sentential logic, the course has been going very well. </p>
			<p>This course has been beneficial so far, and I am now thinking of a project that I will be able to show off.</p>
