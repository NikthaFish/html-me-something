<h1><b>My Education</b></h1>
<ul>
  <li><b></b><b>Pattonville High School<br>
</b>In Pattonville Highschool I spend most of my time either playing Volleyball or participating in speech and debate. I completed in many tournament, having success at the national level and performing well at many tournaments. <br>
</li>
  <li><b></b><b>Southwest Baptist University<br>
</b>Because of my success at Speech an Debate in highschool, I was offered a large scholarship to compete at Southwest Baptist University. I did that for four years while pursuing a double major of philosophy and biblical studies with a minor in ancient semitic languages. At this point, all I knew about my future was that I wanted to pursue more education. <br>
</li>
  <li><b></b><b>St. Louis University<br>
</b>After graduating from Southwest Baptist University I accepted a graduate assistantship at Saint Louis University for their master program in communication. While there I specialized in ethnography and worked closely with several professors to help them with the project.<b> <br>
</b></li>
  <li><b></b><b>LaunchCode<br>
</b>Now that I am finished with my masters degree I am now pursuing being a consultant. As I do that, I would like to add programming to my resume to make myself a more attractive candidate for project management positions. Additionally, coding increasingly becoming an indispensable skill, and I would like to partake in the growth this market is having. <br>
